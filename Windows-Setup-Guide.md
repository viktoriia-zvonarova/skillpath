# SkillPath for Windows Users - Setup Guide

## The Problem
If you downloaded the ZIP file and just double-clicked the HTML file from your Downloads folder, the page might look broken or not work properly. This is because the HTML needs to load additional files and requires internet access.

## Quick Fix (Recommended)

### Step 1: Download and Extract Properly
1. **Download the ZIP** from GitHub by clicking the green "Code" button → "Download ZIP"
2. **Find the ZIP file** in your Downloads folder (usually called `skillpath-main.zip`)
3. **Right-click the ZIP file** → Select "Extract All..."
4. **Choose a permanent location** like your Desktop or Documents folder (NOT in Downloads)
5. Click "Extract"

### Step 2: Open the HTML File Correctly
1. **Open the extracted folder** (should be called `skillpath-main`)
2. **Find `index.html`** (it will have a browser icon)
3. **Right-click on `index.html`** → Select "Open with" → Choose your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

### Step 3: Verify It's Working
- You should see a professional-looking form at the top
- Click "Load Sample Data" to test functionality
- If everything loads correctly, you can now create your roadmap!

## Alternative Method (If Right-Click Doesn't Work)

1. **Open your web browser first** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
2. **Drag and drop** the `index.html` file directly into the browser window
3. Or press `Ctrl+O` in your browser and navigate to select the `index.html` file

## Troubleshooting

### "Page looks broken or missing styles"
- **Cause**: Files weren't extracted properly or opened from wrong location
- **Fix**: Make sure you extracted the ZIP to a permanent folder (not Downloads) and open from there

### "Load Sample Data button doesn't work"
- **Cause**: No internet connection
- **Fix**: Connect to the internet - the PDF export feature needs online libraries

### "Can't find index.html"
- **Cause**: Windows might hide file extensions
- **Fix**: Look for a file just called "index" with a browser/globe icon

### "Nothing happens when I double-click"
- **Cause**: Windows doesn't know which program to use
- **Fix**: Right-click → "Open with" → Choose your browser

## Important Notes

✅ **You MUST have internet access** - The app uses online libraries for charts and PDF generation

✅ **Extract the ZIP first** - Don't try to open the HTML file directly from inside the ZIP

✅ **Use a modern browser** - Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari work best

❌ **Don't open from Downloads folder** - Always extract to a proper location first

## Once It's Working

1. **Click "Load Sample Data"** to see an example roadmap
2. **Fill out the form** at the top to customize your own plan
3. **Click "Export to PDF"** when you're ready to save your roadmap
