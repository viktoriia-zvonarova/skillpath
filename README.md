- **Buffer Time**: Add 20% extra time for unexpected challenges

### 🎯 Skill Selection
- **Focus Over Breadth**: 2-3 core technologies for depth rather than many surface-level
- **Complementary Skills**: Choose technologies that work well together
- **Market Relevance**: Research current industry demands and trends
- **Clear Descriptions**: Write concise, specific descriptions of what you'll learn

### 📊 Professional Presentation
- **Consistent Terminology**: Use the same terms and abbreviations throughout
